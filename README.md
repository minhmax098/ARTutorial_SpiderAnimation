# ARTutorial_SpiderAnimation
This is my first Unity Tutorial video.

I have used Unity AR Foundation to create an Augmented Reality App from scratch.

In this case, I'm using: 

  . Unity 2019.4.3f
  
  . AR Foundation 3.1.16
  
  . AR Core 3.1.18

We will be using a free Spider model from the Asset Store. 

The Placement Indicator art is used from Flaticon.com

Merci beaucoup.
